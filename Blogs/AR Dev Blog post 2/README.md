## The Program
Our AR program is made in Unity with AR Foundation. The program makes use of various managers and some scripts. 
We wanted to be able to look at a sign and then spawn the parking spot anchored on that sign, for this we make use of a `ARTrackedImageManager` to scan the sign.
We define a list of images that contain a image of the sign. We can then scan the sign and have a listener do something once the sign is found.

For initial testing we used a board game to make it easier to work on the project while being home.
Once the image is seen the manager will spawn an object over top of were the image was detected and will transform the spawned object to match the images location and rotation. An events will also be fired with information about what is tracked. By listening to the event that get fired, we can spawn an object and set its parent as the object spawned by the manager.

```cs
public class ParkingAreaSpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] ARTrackedImageManager m_TrackedImageManager;
    [SerializeField] GameObject parckingAreaPrefab;

    void OnEnable() => m_TrackedImageManager.trackablesChanged.AddListener(OnChanged);

    private void OnChanged(ARTrackablesChangedEventArgs<ARTrackedImage> eventArgs)
    {
        if (m_TrackedImageManager.trackables.count > 0 && eventArgs.added.FirstOrDefault()?.transform.childCount == 0)
        {
            var theParckingArea = Instantiate(parckingAreaPrefab);
            theParckingArea.transform.SetParent(eventArgs.added.FirstOrDefault()?.transform, false);
        }
    }
}

```

When the script is triggered by the event firing, it instantiates a prefab and sets its parent as the object added from the manager.

Once the representation of the parking lot is spawn we want to be able to show the location of specific parking spots. For this we had 2 ideas of how we wanted to do this. We wanted to have at least 1 object spawn at the spot, and we wanted another object to points towards the spot.

```cs
public class ParkingSpaceFinder : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Vector3[] parkingSpots;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject marker;
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        var obj = GameObject.Find("ParkingSpaceInput");
        if (obj != null) {
            obj.GetComponent<TMP_InputField>().onValueChanged.AddListener(SearchForParkingSpace);
        }
    }

    void SearchForParkingSpace(string parkingSpace)
    {
        if (int.TryParse(parkingSpace, out int number))
        {
            if (number <= parkingSpots.Length && number > 0)
            {
                marker.SetActive(true);
                marker.transform.localPosition = parkingSpots[number-1];
            } else {
                marker.SetActive(false);
            }
        } else {
            marker.SetActive(false);
        }
    }
}
```

The script looks at a input field and once that changes the a marker object is placed at the position of the parking spot, as specified in a vector3 array. The marker is hidden if no parking space is input.

```cs
public class packingSpacePointerController : MonoBehaviour
{

    [SerializeField] GameObject XROrigin;
    [SerializeField] GameObject pointer;
    private GameObject parckingArea;
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        var obj = GameObject.Find("ParkingSpaceInput");
        if (obj != null) {
            obj.GetComponent<TMP_InputField>().onValueChanged.AddListener(SearchForParkingSpace);
        }
    }

    private void SearchForParkingSpace(string arg0) {
        StartCoroutine(GetCylinder());
    }

    private IEnumerator GetCylinder() {
        yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame();
        parckingArea = XROrigin.GetNamedChild("Cylinder");
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        if (parckingArea != null && parckingArea.activeSelf) {
            pointer.SetActive(true);
            pointer.transform.LookAt(parckingArea.transform.position);
        } else {
            pointer.SetActive(false);
        }
    }
}
```

The pointer script finds the marker object and then points the pointer towards in while it exists and is active.
