Argmented Reality (AR): is an interactive experience that enhances the real world with computer-generated perceptual information.

Virtual Reality (VR): is a computer-generated enviorment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings.

Augmented Virtuality (AV):

Mixed Reality (MR): is an experience that seamlessly blends the real world enviorment and digitally created where both enviorments can coexist and interact with each other.

The Ultimate Display: "Don't think of that thing as a screen, think of it as a window, a window through which one looks into a virtual world. The challenge to computer graphics is to make the virtual world look real, sound real, move and respond to interaction in real time, and even feel real." (Sutherland, 1965)
