## What

Argmented Reality (AR): is an interactive experience that enhances the real world with computer-generated perceptual information.

Virtual Reality (VR): is a computer-generated enviorment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings.

Augmented Virtuality (AV): aims to bring digital elements into a virtual enviorment.

Mixed Reality (MR): is an experience that seamlessly blends the real world enviorment and digitally created where both enviorments can coexist and interact with each other.

The Ultimate Display: "Don't think of that thing as a screen, think of it as a window, a window through which one looks into a virtual world. The challenge to computer graphics is to make the virtual world look real, sound real, move and respond to interaction in real time, and even feel real." (Sutherland, 1965)

Extented Reality (XR) has a wide range of use cases across various industries due to its ability to blend the real and digital worlds.

* Immersive Gaming: VR and AR games offer highly immersive experiences where users can interact with digital enviorments as if they were real.
* Virtual Cinemas & Concerts: Users can attend virtual screenings, live performances, or concerts without leaving their homes, creating immersive social experiences.
* Interactive Storytelling: XR enables users to engage with narratives in ways traditional media cannot, by immersing them directly in the story.

* Simulations for Medical Training: Surgeons, doctors, and medical students can practice procedures in realistic 3D enviorments without risks to patients.
* Technical & Industrial Training: Workers in fields like manufactoring and construction can learn and practice using complex machinery or performing hazardous tasks in a safe virtual enviorment.
