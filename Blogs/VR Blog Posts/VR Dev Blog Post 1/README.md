### Overview
The core of our project is a **VR Maze Game** where the player must escape from a twisting, complex labyrinth. But there's a catch - the player isn't alone. Inspired by the terrifying *Warden* character from *Minecraft*, a relentless creature roams the maze, determined to hunt down the player. The player's mission is simple yet challenging: **avoid the Warden and find the way out before being caught**.

### Game Mechanics
The game emphasizes **survival, exploration, and strategy**. Players must move carefully, as the Warden is sensitive and will hunt based on the player's movements. Players can expect:
- **Puzzle-Like Navigation**: The maze is designed to disorient and challenge, requiring players to think and strategize their escape route.
- **Immersive VR Experience**: Built in VR to enhance realism, providing players with a truly heart-pounding journey through the maze.

### Inspiration: The Warden from Minecraft
The Warden, a terrifying creature from Minecraft, serves as the central antagonist in our VR game. Known for its impressive sensory abilities, the Warden reacts to player movements, making it a perfect fit for VR horror elements. We aim to capture the suspense and thrill that Minecraft players feel when encountering the Warden, translating it into a VR setting where the player’s physical movements and reactions intensify the gameplay experience.
