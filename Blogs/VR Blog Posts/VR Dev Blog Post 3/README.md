### Creating a Lobby for Our VR Project: From Minecraft to Unity
In the development of our VR project, we've focused on creating an immersive and functional starting point for players: the Lobby. We've crafted a Lobby that serves as the player's starting point. Inspired by Minecraft's **Ancient City**, the Lobby combines a mysterious, ancient atmosphere with immersive design. We started by building the Lobby in Minecraft, leveraging its creative tools to design an intricate and thematic space. Once complete, the build was exported into Blender via an OBJ file for refinement. Finally, the model was imported into Unity via FBX file. The result is a visually striking and atmospheric entry point that sets the tone for the VR experience.
