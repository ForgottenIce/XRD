# XR Development - VIA University College
Welcome to our **XR Development** repository!
This Repository facilitates all projects and blog posts we have created for the IT-XRD1-A24 Course at VIA University College.
This involved the development of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.

## Projects
We created two XR projects throughout the course:
1. For our **AR** project, we created a parking finder app that overlays a 3D model of the VIA parking lot into the real world.
2. For our **VR** project, we created a Minecraft inspired game where the Warden creature from Minecraft hunts you down in a randomly generated maze.
